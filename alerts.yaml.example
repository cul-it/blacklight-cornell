# This file can be used to add temporary alert messages to the pages in Blacklight.
# Appropriate handler code should be added to the controllers and views where the
# alerts are to be shown. Each alert consists of two elements: `message`, which contains
# the text to be displayed, and `pages`, which is an array of strings. The pages parameter
# can be used by the handler code to determine whether to show the message on a particular
# page or location, but it will accept arbitrary values.
- message: Message 1 text (<b>HTML tags are ok</b>).
  pages: ['MyAccount']
- message: Message 2 text
  pages: ['Catalog', 'Requests']
