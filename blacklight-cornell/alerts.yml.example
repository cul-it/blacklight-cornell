# This file can be used to add temporary alert messages to the pages in Blacklight.
# Appropriate handler code should be added to the controllers and views where the
# alerts are to be shown. Each alert consists of two elements: `message`, which contains
# the text to be displayed, and `pages`, which is an array of strings. The pages parameter
# should contain an array of path components to match; the message will only appear on a given
# page if an element of the 'pages' array is matched. If 'pages' is empty or omitted
# altogether, then the message will appear on every page in the site.
- message: Message 1 text (<b>HTML tags are ok</b>).
  pages: ['myaccount']
- message: Message 2 text
  pages: ['catalog', 'request']
