  # Next, at a minimum, you need to implement a #search_implementation method,
  # which takes a normalized hash of search instructions as input (see documentation
  # at #normalized_search_arguments), and returns BentoSearch::Results item.
  #
  # The Results object should have #total_items set with total hitcount, and contain
  # BentoSearch::ResultItem objects for each hit in the current page. See individual class
  # documentation for more info.
  def search_implementation(args)
    # 'args' should be a normalized search arguments hash including the following elements:
    # :query, :per_page, :start, :page, :search_field, :sort

    # Use Blacklight::SearchService to get the search results

    # in order to have bento_search process it correctly. We'll split up into different facets
    # once we get back to the controller!
