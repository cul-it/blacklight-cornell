// TODO: There is nothing here, obviously. I tried to get rid of this file, but that cuased a JS error in the console.
// I don't know how it's still being referenced, but something is requiring it to be here -- even if there's no content!
// The only reference I've found is in assets.rb, where it's included in the precompile list. But removing that didn't help.
// But there must be a way to get rid of this file!
