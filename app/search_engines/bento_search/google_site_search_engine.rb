# An adapter for Google Site Search/Google Custom Search
#
# I think those are the same thing now, but may get differnet names
# depending on whether you are paying for getting for free. The free
# version only gives you 100 requests/day courtesy limit for testing.
#
# Create a custom/site search: http://www.google.com/cse
# API docs: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview
# API console to get API key? https://code.google.com/apis/console/?pli=1#project:183362013039
#
# == Limitations
#
# * per-page is max 10, which makes it not too too useful. If you ask for more, you'll get an exception.
# * Google only lets you look at first 10 pages. If you ask for more, it won't raise,
#   it'll just give you the last page google will let you have. pagintion object
#   in result set will be appropriate for page you actually got though.
# * 'abstract' field always filled out with relevant snippets from google api.
# * Google API supports custom 'structured data' in your web pages (from microdata and meta tags?)
#   for custom sorting and limiting and maybe field searching -- but this code
#   does not currently support that. it could be added as custom config in some way.
# * The URL in display form is put in ResultItem#source_title
#   That should result in it rendering in a reasonable place with standard display
#   templates.
# * Sort: only relevance and date_desc. Custom sorts based on structured data not supported.
# * no search fields supported at present. may possibly add later after more
#   investigation, google api may support both standard intitle etc, as well
#   as custom attributes added in microdata to your pages.
# * ResultItem's will be set to have no OpenURLs, since no useful ones can be constructed.
#
# == Required config params
# [:api_key]  api_key from google, get from Google API Console
# [:cx]       identifier for specific google CSE, get from "Search engine unique ID" in CSE "Control Panel"
#
# == Optional config params
#
# [:highlighting]  default false. if true, then title, display url, and snippets will
#                  have HTML <b> tags in them, and be html_safe. If false, plain
#                  ascii, but you'll still get snippets.
