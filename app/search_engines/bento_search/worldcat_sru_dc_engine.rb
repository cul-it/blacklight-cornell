# Attempt to search using the WorldCat Search SRU variant, asking API for
# results in DC format. We'll see how far this takes us.
#
# Does require an API key, and requires OCLC membership/FirstSearch subscription
# for access.
#
# link is set to worldcat.org link. Change config link_base_url to, say,
# link to a worldcat local instance.
#
# == Limitations
# Worldcat SRU APU provides _very little_ usable data on format/type. We provide
# some limited heuristics to try and clean up what IS there, but user-displayable
# format_str may be weird sometimes (and is frequently 'Text'), and machine
# readable semantic #format is often defaulted to "Book", which may not
# always be right.
#
# WorldCat doesn't let you paginate past start_record 9999. If client asks,
# this engine will silenly reset to 9999.
