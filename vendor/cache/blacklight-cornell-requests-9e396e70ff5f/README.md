# Blacklight Cornell Requests

## Overview
This project is a Rails engine designed to plug into a [Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org) instance. It provides functionality for placing requests for materials via Voyager methods (callslip, hold, recall), document delivery, [BorrowDirect](http://www.borrowdirect.org/), interlibrary loan, and more. However, the current codebase is tightly integrated with [Cornell's Blacklight catalog](https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu).
