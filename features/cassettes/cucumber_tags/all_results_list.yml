        are four dialects to the Dakota language : the Santcc,\nYankton, Teton and
        Assiniboin. Each of these dialects has slight\ndifferences, not sufficient
        to prevent Dakotas from understanding\neach other. To give these differences
        would require additional\ncharacters to present fully ; but this has not been
        attempted as the\ndifferences are slight. The dictionary follows in the main
        the Santee\ndialect, with which the author is most familar. The other dialects\ndiffer
        from it in extent, in the order named. The number of different\nwords used
        in the different dialects is small. The different words\nused by the Yanktons
        and Tetons have been mostly noted. The\nnumber of words pronounced differently
        is very large, especially in\nthe Teton dialect. No attempt has been made
        to give all these. A\nfew have been noted to give the student an idea of the
        changes.\nIn the other three dialects the sound of / never occurs, but the
        Teton\nchanges all the (is and many of the ns into I; so Dakota becomes\nLakota;
        nina, very, becomes lila. In the Yankton one of the most\nnotable changes
        is that lid of the Santte becomes krl, and this in the\nTeton becomes tjl.
        Thus, hda, 170 home, in Yankton becomes kda,\nand in Teton gla.\n\nNo attempt
        has been made to give the peculiarities of the Assini-\nboin dialect, as our
        knowledge of it is too limited.\n\nA fuller account of the differences in
        the dialects may be found in\nDr. S. B. Riggs'' \" Dakota Grammar,\" and a
        larger number of the\ndifferent words in his Dakota-English Dictionary, both
        of which are\npublished by the \" Smithsonian Institution,\" Washington, D.
        C.\n\nWhen a ends a word it is often changed to e, principally for\neuphony,
        as ta kta, to te kta.\n\nTO HEAD DAKOTA.\n\nThe Dakota is an easy language
        to read if one will learn the\nsounds of the letters, and stick to them.\n\nThe
        division of the words into syllables is sample. As a rule\nevery vowel ends
        a syllable.    The following are the exceptions :\n\n1. The nasal n always
        closes a syllable; as ka-hin-ta, sweep; wo-\ntarj-in, news.","V.\n\n2.  A
        syllable, contracted by dropping the vowel, is attached to the\npreceding
        syllable, thus making it close with a consonant. Ex.:\nI-pili-ya, cause to
        boil, is contracted from i-pi-ga, boil, and ya, cause.\n\n3.   The words en,
        in, and is, he, she or it, and their compounds, do\nnot close the syllable
        with a vowel.\n\nAccent is very important in Dakota. A misplaced accent is
        as\nbad as a mispronounced letter. Indeed a change of accent often\nchanges
        the meaning of a word; as, ma''^ga means field, whereas\nma-ga'' means goose.\n\nMost
        Dakota words are accented on the second syllable; and, in\nthis dictionary,
        such are not marked. Then, all words commencing\nwith wo are accented on the
        first syllable, and such are not marked.\nThe accent on all other words is
        marked, and the student should\ncarefully note such.\n\nFORMING SENTENCES.\n\n1.   The
        construction of the simple sentence, composed of the bare\nsubject and predicate,
        is the same as in English. Ex.: Zitkadan do-\nwanpi, birds sing.    Wa skan,
        snow melts.\n\n2.   Where the subject has qualifying words they follow the
        word\nthey qualify. Ex.: Wicasta ksapa kin ia, the wise man talks. Zitkadan\nonge
        dowanpi, some birds sing.\n\n3.   When the predicate has qualifying words
        they immediately\nprecede the verb.    Ex.: Jane oiyokipiya dowan, Jane sings
        beautifully.\n\nExceptions. (a) The sign of the future, kta, follows the verb.\nEx.:
        John hi kta, John will come.\n\n(b) The negative, sni, follows ; as, u sni,
        do not conic.\n\n(a) Hii), very, and its compounds hinca and lica, follow
        the verb;\nas, wayazanke hirj, is very sick.\n\n(d) Connective adverbs which
        imply a succeeding clause follow\nthe verb and all other qualifiers. Ex.:
        Yahi kte sni kiijhan, mde kta,\nif you will not come, I will go.\n\n4.   When
        the verb has an object, it precedes the verb but follows\nthe subject.    Ex.:
        John James apa, John struck James.\n\n5.   When the object has qualifying
        words, they follow it. Ex.:\nJohn tahca cepa topa o, John shot four fat deer.","vi.\n\n6.  Where
        a number of words qualify either subject or object,\nthey generally follow
        in the inverse order of the English. Ex.:\nSunktanka cistinna ska wan canpabmihma
        wicinyanna ista-toto ozudan\nyusdobai), a little white horse drew a wagon
        full of blue-eyed girls.\n\n7.   An interrogative sentence is distinguished
        by closing it with\nthe word he. Ex.: Hoksidan waste, he.is a good boy. Hoksidan
        waste\nhe, is he a good boy f\n\n8.  An imperative sentence is distinguished
        by ending it with wo\nor ye. The women use ye and the men generally wo. Ex.:
        Den u\nwo, come here.    Taspan wan maku ye, please give me an apple.\n\nThe
        signs of the interrogative and imperative sentences are some-\ntimes omitted,
        and the fact left to be determined by the connection\nor tone of voice. However,
        the rising inflection is never given for\nan interrogation, but rather the
        opposite.\n\nParts of Speech.\n\nNOUNS.\n\nDakota nouns make no change of
        form on account of number or\ncase, and but seldom of gender.\n\nNumber is
        shown by numerals or other adjectives. Ex.: Tipi wan-\nzi, one house.    Tipi
        ota, many houses.\n\nThe Case, whether objective or nominative is shown, by
        the relative\nposition in the sentence, as already explained. The possessive
        case\nis shown by following the word with tawa, his. Ex.: Tipi de John\ntawa,
        this is John''s house. Sometimes the pronoun tawa is contracted\nto ta and
        prefixed to the principal noun; never to the possessive.\nEx.: John tabanpa
        ku, he gave him John''s moccasins. Sometimes\nagain the possessive case is
        shown only by position. Ex.: He sunka\npa, that is a dog''s head.\n\nGender
        is not distinguished in most nouns. Those referring to\ndifferent classes
        of human beings and a very few of the animals are","vii.\n\ndistinguished.
        Ex.: Wicasta, man. Winohinca, woman. Hehaka, male\nelk. Upan, female elk.
        If it is desired to indicate the sex of any\nneuter noun, wica and winyan
        are added for human beings, and\nmdoka and wiye for animals. Ex.: Hoksiyopa
        wica, a male child.\nSunka mdoka, a male dog. Occasionally they are compounded
        ; as,\ntamdoka, a male deer ; tawiye, a female deer. Female proper names\nvery
        often take the termination win (contraction of winyan); as,\nTatedutawii].
        The same name, Tateduta, Scarlet-Wind, is often given\nto men, but wica (male)
        is never added to it, nor is it to any other\nname for men.\n\nSiniple, derivative,
        and compound nouns are all found in Dakota;\nbut the study of the language
        has progressed so little that there is\nyet much to do before a full presentation
        of them can be given.\nWe, however, state some of the most common ways in
        which nouns\nare formed.\n\nWo prefixed to an adjective or verb transforms
        it into an abstract\nnoun. Ex.: Waste, good: wowaste, goodness. Ka''ta, hot:
        wokata,\nheat. Kiciza, fight: wokicize, a fight. By prefixing wica instead
        of\nwo the object is limited to man; as, kte, kill: wokte, slaughter:\nwicokte,
        human slaughter.\n\n0 prefixed to a verb makes it a verbal noun, with about
        the same\neffect as prefixing the definite article in English ; as, iyuwega,
        sross :\noiyuwega, the crossing. Occasionally it is prefixed to an adjective\nwith
        the same force.\n\nWa prefixed to a transitive verb changes it into a noun,
        signifying\nthe agent; as, apa, strike : waapa, striker. Sometimes the plural
        form\nof the verb is used, making the prefix wica, instead of wo; as, yasic
        ,\nto slander : wicayasica, a slanderer.\n\n1, prefixed to an active verb,
        makes a noun signifying the instru-\nment by which the  action is  done;   as,  kabinta,
        sweep:   icahinte,\n'' broom; yumdu, to plow : iyumdu, a plow.\n\nThe third
        person plural of any verb may be used as a verbal noun;\nas, mani, walk :
        manipi, walking.\n\nKin, after any adjective, noun or clause, shows it is
        used as a\nnoun.","vin.\n\nDai) (F. r.a; T. la) is often suffixed to nouns,
        verbs and adjectives.\nIt is a diminutive, and is generally attached to the
        last word in the\nclause, but refers to the leading noun, whether subjective
        or objec-\ntive ; as, John si; o wan ktedan, John killed a little prairie
        chicken.\n\nCompound nouns are numerous and may be made of any part of\nspeech.
        Sometimes of two nouns ; as, watapeta (fire boat), steam-\nboat; sometimes
        of a noun and adjective: as, hasapa (black skin),\nnee/ro; sometimes of a
        noun and verb: as, liemani (walks on land),\nrailway train.\n\nPKONOUNS.\n\nThe
        personal pronouns are generally incorporated in the verb ; and\nthe objective
        are different from the subjective ; and in incorporate\npronouns the third
        person singular is never expressed, and only the\nsign of the plural for the
        third person plural.\n\nThe subjective incorporate pronouns are: ya, thou;
        wa, // ya pi,\nyou: un-pi, we. Ex.: Kte, he kills; yakte, you kill; wakte,
        / Ml;\nktepi, they kill; unktepi, we kill.\n\nThe objective incorporate pronouns
        are: ni, thee; ma, me; ni--pl,\nyou; un--pi, its. Ex.: Nikte, he kills thee;
        makte, he kills me; niktepi,\nhe kills you ; unktepi, he kills us.\n\nWhen
        both are incorporated they are as follows: ici, he himself;\nni-pi, he you;
        un-pi, he us; maya, thou me; wicaya, thou them ;\nunya pi, thou us; nici,
        thou thyself; miei, I myself; wicawa, I \nthem; ci-pi, I you; ici-pi, they  themselves;
        ni-pi, they-thee, or you;\nma-pi, they-me; wica-pi, they them; un-pi, they-us;
        nici--pi, you \nyourselves; maya-pi, you me; wicaya-pi, you them ; unya--pi,
        you \nus; unkici-pi, we ourselves; urjni-pi, we thee; wicun pi, we them;\nunni-pi,
        wc*-you.\n\nWhen we reach the verb further examples of incorporate pronouns\nwill
        be given. ''\n\nSeparate Personal Pronouns are also found in Dakota. They
        are :\nMiye or mis, /; niye or nis, thou; iye or is, he or she; ui)kiyepi,
        us;\nniyepi, you; iyepi, them. Ex.: lye, niye qa miye unyanpi kta, he, you\nand
        I will go. The same pronouns are used for the objective case.\nEx.: lye, niye
        qa miye kapi, they meant him, thee and me.","be.\n\nThe Possessive Personal
        Pronouns are : Tawa, his; nitawa, thy or\nthine: mitawa, my or mine; tawapi,
        tlieir or theirs; nitawapi, your or\nyours; unkitawapi, o r or ohj\\s. Ex.:
        Tipi tawa, his house. The\npossessive pronouns are often prefixed to the noun,
        in Which case\nthe syllable wa and often the two syllables tawa are stricken
        out.\nEx.: Siha, foot; tasiha, his foot; misiha, my foot; taslhapl, their
        feet.\nMa''ga, field; mita''ma; a, my field. Sometimes the first person singular\nis
        contracted to ma instead of mi; as, mapa, my head.\n\nThere is also a Possessive
        Personal Pronoun that is incorporated\nin the verb. It is : ki, his; ye, thy
        ; we, mine. Ex.: John pte kikte,\nJohn killed his coir.\n\nThe demonstrative
        pronouns are de. this, and he, that; dena, these,\nand hena, those. Also ka,
        that, and kana, those. They have also a\nnumber of compounds, as: decen, like
        this; deceedan, tltis alone;\ndenaos, these two; denakeca, these many.\n\nThe
        interrogative pronouns are tuwe, who ; taku, what; tukte, which ;\nunmaijtukte,
        which or whether; tona, tonaka, tonakeca, how many. The\nabove are either
        subjective or objectirc. The only possessive is tuwe\ntawa, whose.\n\nThe
        only definitive relative pronoun is he, that, who, which, what,\nwhose. Ex.
        : Winoliinca wayazanke cikon he wanna asni, the woman\nwho iras sick is now
        recovered. Any of the interrogative pronouns\nmay be used as indefinite relative
        pronouns. Ex.: Tuwe kte kin tanyan\nsdonyapi, who killed him is well known.\n\nThe
        indefinite pronouns are nearly all the equivalents of the English,\nand are
        used much like adjectives.\n\nVERBS.\n\nIn Dakota the pronoun is incorporated
        in the verb, but for the\nthird person singular no incorporate pronoun is
        used. Therefore,\nfor the hare form of the verb we look to the third person
        singular,\nand not to the infinitive as in English, and that is the form in
        the\nDictionary. Thus, if you look for the verb come you will find u.\nThat
        means he comes. Then yau means you come ; wau, J come ; upi,\nthey come; yaupi,
        you come; urjkupi, we come.    From this you see","X.\n\nthe incorporate subjective
        pronouns are : ya, thou ; wa, I; ya-pl,\nytm ; un-pi, we. Also you will note
        that the sign of the plural, pi,\nis added to the third personal plural, to
        distinguish it from the third\nperson singular, and that in the first person
        plural k is inserted for\neuphony.\n\nIf the verb is transitive, the objective
        pronouns are also inserted.\nThey are : ni, thee; ma, me; wica, them ; ni--pi,
        you ; un-pi, us. As\nan example take the verb kte, kill.\n\nHe kills him,
        kte; he kills thee, nikte; he kills me, makte ; he kills\nthem, wicakte; he
        kills you, niktepi; he kills us, unktepi. Thou killest\nhim, yakte; thou killest
        me, mayakte; thou killest them, wicayakte ;\nthou killest us, unyaktepi. /
        kill him, wakte; / kill thee, cikte; I kill\nthem, wicawakte; / kill you,
        ciktepi. They kill him, ktepi; they kill\nthee, niktepi; they kill me, maktepi;
        they kill them, wicaktepi; they\nkill you, niktepi; they kill us, unktepi.
        Tom kill him, yaktepi; yon\nkill me, mayaktepi; you kill them, wicayaktepi;
        you kill us, unyaktepi.\nWe kill him, unktepi; we kill thee, unniktepi; we
        kill them, wicunktepi;\nwe kill you, unniktepi.\n\nBesides the singular and
        plural numbers given above, the Dakota\nhas also the dual number. It consists
        of the person speaking and\nthe person spoken to, and only in the subjective
        case, and is there-\nfore equivalent to tee tu-o. In form it is the same as
        the plural\nwithout the plural ending pi. Thus, take the verb wanka, lie down
        :\nunwankapi is ire lie down : and unwanka, we two lie down. Intransi-\ntive
        verbs like this can only take one form. Transitive verbs can\ntake the third
        person plural objective pronoun. Thus, with the verb\nkte, kill, two dual
        forms may be used: unkte, tee kill him; and\nwicuT|kte, we kill them. No one
        verb takes more than these two\nforms.\n\nThe relative position of incorporate
        pronouns should be noted.\nThe objective, as a rule, precedes ; as, mayakte,
        you kill me. There\nis one exception. The first person plural pronoun always
        precedes\nthe second person, whether subjective or objective. Ex.: Unniktepi,\nwe
        kill you.\n\nThe position of the pronouns in the verb must also be noted.
        So\nfar the verbs selected have had the pronouns prefixed, and the most\nDakota
        verbs have the pronouns prefixed.    But a large number of","xi.\n\nverbs
        insert them after the first syllable. Ex.: Man), walk; mayaol \nyou walk,
        etc. A few verbs insert the pronouns after the second\nsyllable.    Ex.: ltu\\iar\\,
        give au-ay ; ituwahai), I give away, etc.\n\nThe sign of the plitrat, pi,
        is always placed at the end of the verb.\nEx.: Yuta, eat; uiiyutapi, we cat.
        When an adverbial particle is\nattached to the verb, it is placed after the
        sign of the plural. Ex.:\nThe diminutive particle dan. Hoksiyopa ceyapidan,
        the little babies\ncry.\n\nContractions resulting from the incorporation of
        the pronouns are\nquite numerous. 1. Where wa and ya come before ki the two
        sylla-\nbles are contracted to we and ye; as, wehdega for wakihdega, J over-\ntake
        ; and ayektonza for ayakiktonza, you forget.\n\n2. Where the pronouns come
        before y in the second person, yay is\nchanged to d, and in the first person
        way to md. Ex.: Yatkan, drink,\nbecomes datkan, you drink; and mdatkai), I
        drink. Iyotanka, sits,\nbecomes idotanka, you sit; imdotanka, I sit. One of
        the verbs of this\nclass, yuta, eat, drops its first syllable and prefixes
        the pronouns\nwithout change; as, yata, you eat; wata, / eat.\n\nSECOND  CLASS.\n\nSo
        far we have spoken only of one class of verbs; those which\nhave the corporate
        pronoun wa, /, for the first person singular sub-\njective. We come now to
        speak of another class, in which the first\nperson singular is ma. The class
        is not very numerous, being mostly\nintransitive verbs, and not all of them.
        Ex.: Asni, get well; anisni,\nyou get well; amasni, / get well; asnipi, they
        get well; anisnipi, you\nget well; unkasnipi, we get well. Istinma, sleep;
        nistinma, m tinma,\netc.    Wayazanka, sick; waniyazanka, wamayazanka, etc.\n\nA
        number of verbs in this class make changes in incorporating\nthe pronoun.\n\n1.   Simply
        drop the pronoun vowel. Ex.: Un, use ; nun, thou usest;\nmurj, / use. lhduhomni,
        turn self around; miduhomni, / turn myself\naround, etc. Most reflective verbs
        commencing with ihd take this\nform.\n\n2.   Some, in addition to dropping
        the vowel of the pronoun, drop\nthe succeeding consonant in the verb.     Ex.:  Yanka,
        is situated;","Xll.\n\nmanka, / am situated. Owinza, spread to lie on ; ominza,
        I spread to\nlie on, etc. Iwanga, ask, changes also the succeeding vowel a
        to o;\nthus, inonga, thou askcst; imonga, / ask. In the incorporation of the\nobj''ective
        pronoun the consonant y is restored ; as, imayaaonga, thou\naskest me.\n\n3.
        There are a few verbs which suffix the pronouns, with other\nchanges. Ex.:
        In, wear, prefixes h and suffixes the pronouns, thus :\nhijIni, thou wearest;
        hinmi, I wear. Ecin, consider; ecanmi, / con-\nsider, etc.    Econ, do ; ecanon,
        you do ; ecamoi], / do.\n\nEya, say, together with its compounds heya and
        keya, are alike, but\nstill more irregular. Eha, thou sayest; epa, / say.
        Ehapl, yon say ;\nuijkeyapi, we say.\n\nTHIRD   CLASS.\n\nTo this class belong
        what are called adjective and substantive\nverbs, which have the same set
        of incorporate pronouns as the\nSecond Class, and we speak of them separately
        because of the pecu-\nliarity of their formation and the great extent to which
        they are\nused.    Any adjective or noun may be so used.\n\nThe construction
        is much the same as the use in English of the\nadjective and substansive verbs
        with the copula. But in Dakota\nthe copula is omitted. Thus : John is tall,
        in Dakota is John hanska.\nHere is a complete sentence, a definite assertion,
        with what appears\nto be only a noun and adjective. But hai]ska is here more
        than an\nadjective, or it would not be an assertion. The two words are used\nto
        assert that John is tall. It is then more than an adjective. It is\na complete
        predicate, and combines the powers of adjective and\nverb.  \n\nPerhaps a
        clearer analysis would be to say that it is predicate\nadjective, and that
        in Dakota the copula is understood with predi-\ncate adjectives and nouns.\n\nThese
        predicates, from the nature of the case, have no objective\npronouns, and,
        as already stated, the subjective'' incorporate pro-\nnouns are of the Second
        Class. And, like other classes, they are\nincorporated between different syllables.
        Ex.: Waste, he is good;\nniwaste, thou art good ; mawaste, / am good; wastepi,
        they are good ;\nniwastepi, you are good; ui|wastepi. ire arc good. Dakota,
        he is a\nDakota; Damakota, I am a Dakota ; Danikota, thou art a Dakota, etc.","Xlll.\n\nIn
        some instances the student may be at a loss to know whether\nan adjective
        or a noun is in the predicate or not. For instance, does\nJohn hanska mean
        John is tall or tall John. It might mean either,\nand so is ambiguous. But
        in fact one need seldom be in doubt. In\nthis case, if the connection shows
        that John hanska is a complete\nsentence, it must mean John is tall. Whereas
        if another predicate\nfollows, and the full sentence is, John hanska wanna
        hi, then hanska\nis only an adjective, and the translation is, Tall John lias
        come.\n\nTENSE.\n\nAs we have now seen, inflections in the form of the verb
        show\nvery fully the person and number to which it relates. In the matter\nof
        time and mode no changes are made in the form of the verb.\nTense and mode
        are shown by auxiliaries and not by inflection.\n\nThe time expressed in the
        body of the verb is aorist, that is, inde-\nfinite, completed time. And it
        is used both for the past and present.\nEx.: Wanhinkpe wakage, / made an arrow.\n\nThe
        definite time is often shown by circumstances. Ex.: {Pre-\nsent) Taku yakagahe?
        what are yon making? Wanhinkpe wakaga, 1\nam making an arrow. Sometimes it
        is shown by adverbs of time.\nEx.: {Preterite) Htanihan wanhinkpe wakaga,
        yesterday I made an\narrow. (Perfect) Wanna mdustan, I hare finished it. If
        the present\ntense is to be distinguished, dehan is the most definite word,
        though\nwanna is also used.\n\nFuture time is shown by the auxiliary kta,
        which is placed imme-\ndiately after the verb.    Ex.: Wakage kta, i\" will
        make it.\n\nThe future perfect has no regular form of expression. Sometimes\nit
        is not distinguished from the future. Ex.: Do good and you will\nnot have
        lived in vain, taku waste econ, ka ituya yani kte sni. Some-\ntimes wanna
        is introduced as in the present perfect. Ex.: Will he\nhave collected enough
        money ? Mazaska iye wanna mnaye kta he.\n\nMODES.\n\nAs already stated there
        are no changes of inflection to designate\ndifferent modes. The Indicative
        is the regular form, the only one I\nhave so far referred to.","xiv.\n\nThe
        Subjunctive Mode, being one of conditional assertion, is made\nby adding kinhan,
        unkaus; sta, kes, or some other conditional eon-\njunction to the end of the
        clause. Ex.: Yahi sni kii|hai|, mde kte sni,\nif you do not come, I will not
        go.\n\nThe Dakota is not adapted to the classification of a Potential Mode.\nThe
        different senses of our English auxiliaries would require many\nmore auxiliary
        verbs in Dakota. Ex.: / can (am able to) go, mda\nowakihi. / can (am permitted
        to) go, mda iyowinmakiyapi. Then\nagain, many potential clauses are paraphrased
        in Dakota. Ex.: It\nmay be so, okini hecetu.    Whatever may happen, toketu
        ceyas.\n\nThe Imperative Mode is formed by placing certain particles imme-\ndiately
        after the bare form of the verb. The regular particles used\nare wo and ye,
        in the singular, and po and pe in the plural. Vo and\npo are used in command,
        and ye and pe in entreaty. For propriety''s\nsake the women never use the
        former. Ex.: U wo, come. U ye, do\ncome {or please come).    These are said
        only to a single person.\n\nWith transitive verbs the Imperative takes the
        objective pronouns.\nEx. When a single person is spoken to : Ku wo, give it
        to him.\nWhen more than one is spoken to : Wicaku po, give it to them.\n\nInstead
        of pe, miye is sometimes used, and this again is sometimes\ncontracted to
        m. Ex.: Instead of Irjyanka pe, run, they sometimes\nsay hjyanka miye, and
        sometimes inyankam.\n\nSometimes the sign of the Imperative is omitted.\n\nTHE   INFINITIVE.\n\nWhen
        the Infinitive is the object of a verb the root form is used.\nEx.: U cirj,
        he wants to come.\n\nThere is no sign of the Infinitive, but the sign of the
        future is\ngenerally used.    Ex.: U kta cirj, lie wants to come.\n\nThe Infinitive
        takes the incorporate pronouns. Ex.: Kicizapi cirjpi,\nthey want to fight.    Wicakizapi
        cinpi, they want to fight them.\n\nWhen the infinitive is the subject of another
        verb it takes the\nform of the third person plural.    Ex.: Waijyakapi he
        wicadapi ee, tc\n\nsec is to believe.","XV.\n\nTHE  PARTICIPLE.\n\nThe Present
        Participle takes the root form of the verb. Ex.: Ho-\nksidan wan inyanka wanmdaka,
        / sow a boy running.\n\nThe Past Participle takes the form of the third personal
        plural.\nEx.: Wicasta nakaha ktepi iyewaya, / discovered a man just killed.\n\nThe
        transitive participle takes an object. Tahca kute unklpi, we\nwent shooting
        deer.\n\nTHE  PASSIVE  VOICE.\n\nThe Dakota verb has no distinctive form for
        the Passive Voice.\nInstead of saying: / was struck by John, they say, John
        struck me,\nJohn amapa.\n\nWhere the form is the indefinite passive the third
        person plural\nactive is always used. Ex.: John was struck, John apapl; that
        is,\nthey struck John. He was a man that was loved, wicasta wastedapi\nheca.\n\nOTHER
        VERBAL  MODIFICATIONS.\n\nThe Dakota verb has some other modal changes peculiar
        to the\nlanguage. Sometimes a syllable is repeated to indicate repetition\nof
        action. Ex.: Apa, strike ; apapa, strike repeatedly. The accented\nsyllable
        is generally repeated.\n\nThen there is a set of causative incorporate verbal
        prefixes which\nshow the manner of the action. They are : ba, bo, ka, na,
        pa, ya and\nyu. Ba means it is done with a sawing motion ; bf, by a blowing,\nshooting
        or punching motion ; ka, by a striking or sweeping motion ;\nna, by kicking
        or bursting ; ya, by biting ; yu, in an indefinite man-\nner. These prefixes
        are attached to verbal roots, neuter verbs and\nadjectives. Ex.: Ksa (root),
        separate; baksa, separate by cutting ;\nboksa, by blowing, etc. Ska (adj.),
        white; yiska, make white. Ta,\ndie ; kata, cause to die by striking.\n\nThere
        is also a causative suffix, yr% with the same meaning as the\nprefix yu. Thus:
        nazin, stand; yunazii) and nazinya, are both used\nfor, cause to stand. Some
        verbs take the suffix and some the prefix ;\nrarely either may be used. The
        suffix can only be used with other\nverbs.","XVI.\n\nADJECTIVES.\n\nThe Dakota
        adjective, like the noun, is not declined. There are\nno changes for person,
        number, or case.\n\nComparison is shown by qualifying words : sanpa, more,
        and iyotarj,\nmost.    Ex.: Good, waste; better, sanpa waste; best, iyotan
        waste.\n\nAnother form is sometimes used. If one asks, Winch is the larger
        t\nhe says, tukte tanka? And if the other replies, This is larger than\nthat,
        he says, de tanka he cistinna.\n\nReduplication of a syllable expresses much
        the same idea as with\nthe verb, but as it implies the plural, it is sometimes
        spoken of as\nthe plural. Ex. : Mdo wasteste, nice potatoes. The true sense
        is\ndoubtless, potatoes successively nice.\n\nThe plural ending pi is often
        attached to adjectives, but as we\nunderstand, it is a verbal termination,
        and is properly attached only\nto verbal adjectives. Ex.: Wicasta wastepi,
        they are good men. Wi-\ncasta waste hipi, good men have come.\n\nADVERBS.\n\nAdverbs
        need cause the student no trouble, as there are few\nchanges from the form
        found in the dictionary. As in English, they\nqualify verbs, adjectives and
        other adverbs.\n\nTheir position is immediately before the word they qualify.
        Ex.:\nMe did well, tanyan ecoi).    There are a few exceptions to this rule.\n\n(a)   The
        negative sni, not; and hiijca, very, follow the words they\nqualify.    Ex.:
        Ecamon sni, / did not do it.    Tanka hinca, very large.\n\n(b)  Interrogative
        pronouns are the first words in the sentence. Ex.:\nTokeca nitapi kta he.
        Why will ye die f (c) He, which might be\ncalled an interrogative exclamation,
        always closes the sentence.\nEx.: Yau he.    Are you coming ''!\n\nThe number
        of primitive adverbs in Dakota is not large, but the\nfacility of forming
        derivatives is ready and well improved. They\nmay be formed from any part
        of speech, but are largely formed from\nadjectives, verbs, pronouns and adverbs.\n\n1.
        The suffix ya (or yan) attached to an adjective or verb transforms\nit into
        an adverb with much the effect as the suffix ly in English.","XV11.\n\nEx.:
        Sica, bad; sicaya,badly,    \\yusk\\i), rejoice ; lyuskinyan, rejoicingly.\nSometimes
        there is a contraction : Onsika, poor ; orjsiya, poorly.\n\n2. The demonstrative
        pronouns are transformed into a large num-\nber of adverbs, mostly by suffixes.\n\n(a)  The
        suffix en, in, contracted makes den, here, and hen, there;\nalso tukten, where,
        and kan, yonder, etc.\n\n(b)   The suffixes ki, ci, kiya and ciya make adverbs
        used with verbs\nof motion.    Ex.: Kaki, that way ; deciya, this way.\n\n(c)  The
        suffixes ken and cen make adverbs of manner. Ex.: Decen,\nin this manner.    Kaken,
        in that manner.\n\n(d)  The suffixes nan and ban form adverbs of time and
        locality.\nEach may refer to time or place, which is to be determined by the\nconnection.
        Han conveys the idea of at; hai] of to. Thus : behan,\nat that time, or at
        that place; heban, to that time, or to that place.\nEx.: Hehan ecamon kta,
        / will do it at that time (then) ; hehan ehde\nkta, lie tvill set it up at
        that place (there). Hehan wani kinhan, if I live\nto that time (MB then) ;
        hehan wai kinhai), if I go to (reach) that place.\n\nTo form adverbs from
        other adverbs there are a number of suffixes\nused. Tkiya has about the same
        force as the English suffix wards.\nEx.: kun, down ; kuntkiya, downwards.
        The suffix yan has the force\nof to. Ex.: Hehan, there; hehanyarj, to there.
        Sometimes they are\naccumulative, with only the object of holding to the idea.
        Ex :\nDehan, now ; dehantu, at now ; dehantuya, about at now ; dehantuyaken,\nsomewhere
        at about now.\n\nPrepositions are sometimes transformed into adverbs by suffixing\ntu,
        tuya, ya and wapa.    Ex.: Mahenya iyotanka, he sat inside.\n\nPREPOSITIONS.\n\nPrepositions
        have no proper inflection, but where they govern the\nobjective pronoun the
        pronoun is generally incorporated in the pre-\nposition. Ex.: Sunka niyahna
        hi, a dog came with you. In the union\nthey are often contracted. Ex.: Micahda
        (miye icahda) iyotanka, sit by\nme. The objective pronouns are not always
        incorporated. Ex.:\nMiye etkiya u, he comes towards me.\n\nWhen the preposition
        governs nouns, or unincorporate pronouns,\nits position is not before but
        after the word it governs and its quali-\nfying words.    Ex.: Tlpi ska tanka
        etanhan, from the big white house.","xviii.\n\nThere are a number of prepositions
        in Dakota that are incorpor-\nated into other words.\n\nTo nouns are affixed
        ta, ata and yata, all meaning at or to. Ex.:\nTiyata un, he is at the house.
        Canyata iyaya, he has gone to the moods.\nAkaa, on, is often suffixed. Ex.:
        Heakan, on the hill. En is also\nsuffixed, but generally contracted to n,
        Ex. : Tin u, come in the\nhouse.\n\nThe first four vowels are used as prepositional
        attachments to\nintransitive verbs, enabling them to take an object, and occasionally\nto
        a transitive verb, enabling it to take a second object. The prefix\na has
        the force of on. Ex.: Caga amani, he walked on the ice. The\nprefix e signifies
        to. Ex.: Atkuku ekindega, he overtook (reached to)\nhis father. The prefix
        i meajs/oc, on account of. Ex.: Cekiya, pray ;\nicekiya, pray for. The prefix
        o means in. Ex.: Kastan, pour ; oka-\nstar), pour in.\n\nPrepositions are
        both primitive and compound, but neither are\nnumerous; neither is their composition
        intricate. One of the most\nnumerous classes of derivatives is formed from
        adverbs of place by\nprefixing i. Ex.: Walk behind, hekta mani; walk behind
        the horse,\nsunktanka ihektam mani.\n\nCONJUNCTIONS.\n\nThe form and construction
        of conjunctions is so simple and so\nsimilar to the English that we need use
        no space for them here.\n\nEXCLAMATIONS.\nExclamations are plentiful, but
        often local, and soon change.\n\nThe Dictionary.\n\nThe abbreviations are
        mostly the same as found in other diction-\naries, with the following exceptions.
        S. stands for Santee; Y. for\nYankton; and T. for Teton.\n\nThe most common
        definition is placed first.","English-Dakota Dictionary\n\nA\n\na, a. Wan;

        <dc:description>Subject: While it is not difficult to find data in many cases, it can be very difficult to find quality data. Chemical Information for Chemists could help with this problem and more. This is a chemical information book specifically aimed at practising chemists. Written and edited by experts in the field, it is ideal for chemists who lack a chemical information professional able to teach basic and intermediate techniques in retrieving and evaluating information using the unique entry points of the chemical literature, including structure, formula, substructure and sequence. It can be used as a desk reference or form the basis for a graduate or undergraduate course in chemical information. Although the book is intended primarily for chemists and chemistry students, new chemical information specialists will also find it a useful guide through the challengingly diverse chemical literature.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Information literacy and library instruction are at the heart of the academic library's mission. But how do you bring that instruction to an increasingly diverse student body and an increasingly varied spectrum of majors? Here, over twenty library instructors share their best practices for reaching out to today's unique users. Readers will find strategies and techniques for teaching college and university freshmen, community college students, students with disabilities, and those in distance learning programs. You will also find proven approaches to teaching students in the most popular programs of study -- English Literature, Art and Art History, Film Studies, History, Psychology, Science, Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Hospitality, and International Marketing. Three additional chapters guide instructors through teaching legal, government information, and patent searching. Each chapter covers instructional design, lesson planning, library/faculty collaborations, marketing programs, assessment. The companion CD-ROM features several of the lesson plans, presentations, brochures, worksheets, handouts, and evaluation forms discussed in the book.</dc:description>

        programs offered by companies like Aspen Technology Inc., and the chemical
        engineering students. The methodology consists of creating a tutorial which
        illustrates, in an interesting way, subjects through engineering software
        packages. The main theme treated in this tutorial is distillation column simulation
        and design; it also includes a brief look into distillation column control
        by means of dynamic simulations. This article presents an interactive guide
        with three case studies, where the subjects of design and control for a binary
        simple system and the development of a simulation for a complex ternary system
        are studied. These guides were implemented in Separation Processes and Process
        Design courses and the guide evaluation results show an acceptance by the

        schools should teach students how to use the software that they will use at
        work. This article shows the importance to promote a closer relationship between
        the engineering computer programs offered by companies like Aspen Technology
        Inc., and the chemical engineering students. The methodology consists of creating
        a tutorial which illustrates, in an interesting way, subjects through engineering
        software packages. The main theme treated in this tutorial is distillation
        column simulation and design; it also includes a brief look into distillation
        column control by means of dynamic simulations. This article presents an interactive
        guide with three case studies, where the subjects of design and control for
        a binary simple system and the development of a simulation for a complex ternary
        system are studied. These guides were implemented in Separation Processes
        and Process Design courses and the guide evaluation results show an acceptance
        by the students. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Comput Appl Eng Educ 19: 621–630,

        <dc:relation>Review: "The first comprehensive resource on this important topic, this set covers the origins of homelessness, current research, and strategies for its prevention. The contributors represent such disciplines as sociology, anthropology, medicine, and social work. Articles address homelessness in eight major American cities and more than 30 cities and nations around the world. Adding depth are bibliographies, a directory of street newspapers, a filmography, and more than 20 primary-source documents offering historical and contemporary perspectives."--"Reference that rocks," American Libraries, May 2005.</dc:relation>

        <dc:creator>Howells, Cyndi.</dc:creator>
        <dc:date>©1999</dc:date>
        <dc:description>REF Ths is a multi-title review. The titles include: 'Cyndi's List (880 pg)', 'Instant Information on the Internet (117 pg)', and 'Instant Information on the Internet (86 pg)' - Although Internet directories such as Howells's wildly popular site, (www.cyndislist. com), offer well-organized access to genealogy sites online, many researchers still want to plan searches with a book in hand. Now Howells (Netting Your Ancestors) has created a print version, with some exceptions, of her web site. Including over 100 categories and over 40,000 links (most with brief annotations), this book has something for nearly any genealogy-related topic that comes to mind.Schaefer's 'Instant Information' series offers pared-down compilations of basic information search sites. Her book on the United States categorizes web sites by state and includes vital records information sites, prominent research libraries and societies, indexes and databases, and general information sites. In the British Isles book, Schaefer discusses British counties and expands her lists to include major sites for churches and the Celtic language as well as a place-name index.All three books provide easy access to useful genealogy sites. While Howells strives for exhaustive coverage of genealogy links, Schaefer offers very general site lists. Though Howells's book comes with a solid price tag, the purchase of each new (and planned) title in Schaefer's series would quickly rack up the same price or more. Still, for those who want only a brief, focused guide, Schaefer's books are an economical alternative. Elaine M. Kuhn, Allen Cty. P.L., Fort Wayne, IN-</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Sixth edition.</dc:description>
        <dc:description>Includes index.</dc:description>
        <dc:description>For the sixth edition, James D. Hart and Phillip Leininger have updated the Companion in light of what has happened in American literature since 1982. To this end, they have revised the entries on such established authors as Saul Bellow, Norman Mailer, and Joyce Carol Oates, and they have added more than 180 new entries on novelists (T. Coraghessan Boyle, Tim O'Brien, Louise Erdrich, Don De Lillo), poets (Rita Dove, Weldon Kees), playwrights (Wendy Wasserstein, August Wilson), popular writers (Stephen King, Louis L'Amour), historians (James M. McPherson, David Herbert Donald, William Manchester), naturalists (Aldo Leopold, Edward Abbey), and literary critics (Camille Paglia, Richard Ellmann). In addition, the Companion boasts more women's, African-American, and ethnic voices, with new entries on such luminaries as Charlotte Perkins Gilman, M.F.K. Fisher, William Least Heat-Moon, Ursula Le Guin, and Oscar Hijuelos, among many others. With over 5,000 total entries, The Oxford Companion to American Literature reflects a dynamic balance between past and contemporary literature, surveying virtually every aspect of our national literature, from the Pulitzer Prize to pulp fiction, and from Walt Whitman to William F. Buckley, Jr. There are over 2,000 biographical profiles of important American authors (with information regarding their styles, subjects, and major works) and influential foreign writers as well as other figures who have been important in the nation's social and cultural history. There are more than 1,100 full summaries of important American novels, stories, essays, poems (with verse form noted), plays, biographies and autobiographies, tracts, narratives, and histories. The new edition provides historical background and astute commentary on literary schools and movements, literary awards, magazines, newspapers, and a wide variety of other matters directly related to writing in America. Finally, the book is thoroughly cross-referenced and features an extensive and fully updated index of literary and social history.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>"Thousands of titles chronicle centuries of American history, culture and daily life."</dc:description>
        <dc:description>For searching and browsing American newspapers published in three centuries, America's Historical Newspapers is the most comprehensive online resource available. Continually expanding, it offers searchable digital facsimiles of thousands of titles from all 50 states. With eyewitness reporting, editorials, letters, advertisements, obituaries and much more, this acclaimed collection uniquely chronicles the evolution of American culture and daily life from 1690 to the recent past. America's Historical Newspapers features Early American Newspapers, 1690-1922; 20th-Century American Newspapers, Series 1-3; and American Ethnic Newspapers. The latter includes African American Newspapers, 1827-1998, Hispanic American Newspapers, 1808-1980; and Ethnic American Newspapers from the Balch Collection, 1799-1971.</dc:description>
        <dc:description>Series 1-7 offers more than 300 significant 18th-, 19th- and 20th-century newspapers from all 50 present states. Series 1, 1690-1876: contains more than 700 historical American newspapers from 23 states and the District of Columbia printed between 1690 and 1876. Focusing largely on the 18th century, Series 1 is based on Clarence S. Brigham's "History and Bibliography of American Newspapers, 1690-1820" and other bibliographies. Series II, 1758-1900: With more than one million pages from over 200 18th- and 19th-century newspapers, Series II focuses on the period between 1820 and 1860, when the number of titles began to rise dramatically as westward expansion and the penny press helped create thousands of local newspapers and daily editions replaced many weeklies. Along with Series III, Series II provides in-depth coverage of the mid-19th century, including the Civil War. Series III, 1829-1922: With over 125 additional 19th- and 20th-century newspapers totaling more than one million pages, Series III focuses on the period between 1861 and 1900. Its coverage includes the Civil War, Reconstruction and the Progressive Era and extends to World War I and beyond. Many of the titles in Series IV are of historical significance, including The Liberator, William Lloyd Garrison's powerful anti-slavery newspaper. Others include the New Orleans Daily Creole, the first African-American newspaper in America Siwinowe Kesibwi (Shawnee Star), the first newspaper in Kansas and the first to be printed wholly in a native American language the Gaceta de Texas, the first newspaper in Texas and the Maryland Gazette, the oldest continuously published newspaper in America.
